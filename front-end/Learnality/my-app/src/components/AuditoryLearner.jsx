                            <p>Auditory learners understand information best when they are given verbal instructions. Only 30% of school students are auditory learners. They often memorise best by hearing and speaking out loud. They may talk a lot and interrupt others. They remember names better than faces. Noise and music is very distracting and they donâ€™t benefit as much as other learners from pictures or practical activities. When listening, they often look distracted, and like they are listening to their thoughts, with their eyes looking down to the right. They often play musical instruments and sing or hum to themselves when busy. </p>
