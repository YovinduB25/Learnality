                            <p>Kinesthetic learners learn effectively through touch,
                                movement and space. They also learn skills by
                                imitation and practice. They appreciate instructors
                                who use real-life examples and prefer hands-on
                                approaches to learning. Predominantly kinesthetic
                                learners can appear slow, in that information is
                                normally not presented in a style that suits their
                                learning methods. </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Handle objects, tools or machinery that you are
                                    studying. For example, handle the rocks in a
                                    geology class, or repeat computer applications
                                    several times. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Cut charts or diagrams apart so that you can
                                    practice assembling them in their correct order. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Use exaggerated movements and hand gestures
                                    when you study. Drama, dance, pantomime and
                                    role-playing use large muscle movements. Moving or pointing fingers and expressing information
                                    and emotions through hand gestures involve small
                                    muscle movement.

                                    Use a computer to type information and access muscle memory through keyboard strokes. 
                                </li>
                                <li>Walk as you recite or practice information. Pacing
                                    or walking with study materials in hand helps
                                    some people learn without being distracted by the
                                    discomfort of sitting too long. 
                                </li>
                                <li>Work at a chalkboard, flip chart or large poster
                                    paper to create study tools. List, draw, practice
                                    or write while you stand up and work on a large
                                    surface.
                                </li>
                                <li>  Learn through creative movement and activities.
                                      For example, if you are studying perimeters in
                                      math, tape off an area of a room and walk the
                                      perimeter. 
                                </li>
                            </ul>
