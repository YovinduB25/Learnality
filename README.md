# Learnality
**Software Development Group Project CS-23**

**Short Description**

**What's the problem?**

Teachers struggle to recognize and differentiate pupils based on their learning styles. Researchers devised a plan to assess students' learning styles and personality types. Students may learn about their personalities and play to their strengths and weaknesses with the help of this project. The "Learnality" initiative will provide learning resources for both parties.


**The Idea**

This project is conducted to adequate our research on the identification and classification of learning styles in combination with personality identification. Teachers can analyze the data and suggest perfect teaching methods to identify the learning style of the students in the classroom. The goal of this project is to develop a web application that determines learning styles using personality types.
