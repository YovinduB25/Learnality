Software Development Group Project CS-23

**Project Brief**

Teachers should be conscious of both their student's personalities and their learning styles to improve the effectiveness of their teaching and learning methods over time.  In our research, we have come across several websites and software applications that use surveys to determine the learning and personality styles individually.  Therefore, this project is conducted to adequate our research on the identification and classification of learning styles in combination with personality identification to assist both educators and students. The goal of this project is to design, develop, and deploy a web application that determines learning styles using personality types by evaluating student behavior, therefore assisting both students and teachers. Teachers can also analyze the data and suggest perfect teaching methods to identify the individuality and learning style of the students in the classroom.


**Project Developmemt**

This procedure includes a web application that requires the user to log in as either a student or a teacher. They will be led to the homepage, which has two quiz pages, once they have registered in. These questionnaires include VARK and OCEAN-related questions. Users are directed to a dashboard page based on the quiz's analysis once they have completed the quiz. This page identifies the user's learning style and personality type. Users can get their reports in pdf format using this analysis, which provides the best way to learn something using the detected learning type. Additionally, instructors or teachers have access to the students' dashboard, which allows them to tune their teaching to the student's preferred learning style. The front end of the web application was built with React.js, while the wireframes were designed with Figma. Flask and Python are the main technologies used in the backend. The quiz's user information and user inputs were stored in MongoDB.
